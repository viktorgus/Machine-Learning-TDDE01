# Machine-Learning-TDDE01
Lab assignments from 2019.
Also completed optional special tasks.

## Lab 1
- KNN and Logistic regression classification.
- Exponential distrubution modeling.
- Feature selection by cross-validation in a linear model.
- Linear regression and regularization with LASSO and RIDGE.

## Lab 2
- Prediction with LDA and Logistic regression of lifetimes.
- Decision tree classification of credit scores.
- Regression tree analysis and confidence intervals.
- PCA and ICA

## Lab 3
- Weather prediction with kernel model.
- Kernel SVM for spam prediction.
- Neural network prediction of sin function and analysis of generalisation. 

## Special tasks
- Implementation of Random LASSO, which is a version of LASSO regression where several bootstrap samples are used to compute importance measures depending on size of coefficients that are then used to select the final regressors with a corresponding probability. This eliminates some weakness with regular LASSO, as regular LASSO will typically remove all correlated regressors except one, and this might not be desirable if the model aims to find all significant factors.
- Usage of Model-Based decision trees, that fits any model at a regular decision tree's terminal nodes instead of a piecewise function.
- Derivation and implementation of gradient descent in a two layer NN using chain rule of derivatives for the network and corresponding vector algebra.

(Note that code for special tasks is found in the report's code appendix)
